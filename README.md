### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort works by first comparing the first number with the rest. It swaps places with any number that is greater than it. It does this down the line of numbers until everything is sorted.


####Psuedo code
```sh

while array is unsorted,

loop through the array starting at the first value.

compare it with the value to its right. swap places if its greater.

continue making passes until array is fully sorted
```
